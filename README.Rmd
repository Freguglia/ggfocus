#ggfocus

## Introduction

Many times during data analysis, one may want to visualize data for a specific subgroup of observations. While ggplot is great for data visualization in general, constructing graphics that focus on those subgroups may need very troublesome manipulation of data and graphical scales (for example colors), i.e. setting low alpha for unimportant observations, coloring things in a way that highlights the focus subgroup, etc.

**ggfocus** allows you to build graphics that focus on those specific subgroups by doing the scale manipulation automatically while keeping all the flexibility from ggplot. The idea behind this approach is from [this](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/2627) issue from tidyverse/ggplot2.


## Installing ggfocus

The package is available in CRAN, but you can also install the latest version from github with [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Freguglia/ggfocus") # Latest version
install.packages("ggfocus") # CRAN version
```

## Usage 

*ggfocus* implements the *ggfocus()* function.

```{r gfocus, eval=FALSE}
ggfocus(p, var, focus_levels, focus_aes = c("color", "alpha"),
  color_focus = NULL, color_other = "black", alpha_focus = 1,
  alpha_other = 0.05)
```

- **p**: a ggplot.
- **var**: the factor variable that you want to specify levels to focus (note that this can be a numeric variable that represents a factor, i.e., you gave an integer number to each 'level', like an integer ID or a character variable).
- **focus_levels**: a vector of levels (either character or numeric) to highlight.
- **focus_aes**: which aesthetics should be used to highlight the levels. Currently only **color**, **alpha** and **fill** are available. A character vector is expected.
- **color_focus**: what color selected levels should have? It can be either one color (all equal) or character vector with one color for each level. This affects both **color** and **fill**.
- **color_other**: color for levels not selected.
- **alpha_focus** and **alpha_other**: alpha for selcted and not selected levels, respectively.

 You can also use the usual `ggplot2` grammar `+` to add scales with the family of function `scale_*_focus()`. These two uses are equivalent, read the vignette for more information.


## Examples

Using the *gapminder* dataset, first we create our ggplot
```{r ex1_create}
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=log(gdpPercap), y=lifeExp, group=country)) + geom_line()
p
```

Now we can use *ggfocus()* to highlight European countries only.

```{r}
library(ggfocus)
ggfocus(p, continent, "Europe")
```

We can also highlight countries

```{r}
ggfocus(p, country, c("Brazil","Argentina"), color_focus = c("Green","Blue"))
```

### Interaction with other extensions
Because **ggfocus()** retuns a modified **ggplot** object, other ggplot extensions can used with it, for example, [gganimate](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(gganimate)
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=log(gdpPercap), y=lifeExp, size=pop, frame=year)) + geom_point()
focus_p <- ggfocus(p,country,c("Brazil","Argentina"), color_focus = c("Green","Blue"))
gganimate(focus_p,interval=.2)
```
```{r, out.width = "600px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/focus_gapminder.gif")
```

#### Using ggfocus with ggmaps

```{r}
library(ggmap)
library(maps)

wm <- map_data("world")
p <- ggplot(wm, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group)) + geom_polygon(color="black") + theme_void()
ggfocus(p, region, c("Brazil","India","Italy","Canada"),focus_aes = c("fill","alpha"),
        color_focus = "blue", alpha_other = 0.15) + guides(fill=FALSE)
```
